# USB-interfaced-Slide-changer

Implementation of a remote-controlled slide changer using RF technology and LPC2148 microcontroller connected to PC. For the transmission 
side, PCB was designed. At receiving end, the microcontroller was converted into HID device so that the PC recognizes it as a keyboard. 
Worked on USB concepts such as endpoints, descriptors, the transaction of tokens and different report formats.
